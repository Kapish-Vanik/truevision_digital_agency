  "summary": "Implemented a centralized branding logo configuration in `frontend/src/config/site.ts`, added a reusable `BrandLogo` component, and updated Navbar/Footer to use it. However, the diff summary does not show the new logo image files being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, nor does it demonstrate removal of the previously hardcoded `...dim_512x512.png` usage across the codebase.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Add the official TrueVision Digital Agency logo as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them from a central configuration; ensure old hardcoded /assets/generated/truevision-logo-mark.dim_512x512.png is not loaded unless explicitly kept as fallback.",
      "reason": "While `frontend/src/config/site.ts` now exposes logo paths and alt text, the diff summary does not show any new image assets being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and it does not provide evidence that the old `...dim_512x512.png` path is no longer used elsewhere (or only used as an explicit fallback).",

      "reason": "Navbar and Footer were updated to use the centralized `BrandLogo`, but the diff summary does not include evidence of updating any other potential logo usages, nor does it demonstrate that references to `/assets/generated/truevision-logo-mark.dim_512x512.png` were removed across the project.",
